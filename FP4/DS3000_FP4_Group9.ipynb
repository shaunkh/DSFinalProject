    "<h4>Problem Statement</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors aim to identify unicorn companies with high valuations among a large pool of investment options. Venture capitalism has historically been focused on sourcing relationships with founders, conducting due diligence, and often basing investment decisions on intuition and experience rather than data. With the increased availability of start up information, we aim to develop a concrete model to support investors in determining the likelihood of start up success. We hope to gain a greater understanding of the key considerations of due diligence and how to best leverage these data points to create an accurate predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, failure is a costly but effective way to train a venture capitalist. With increased access to data surrounding early stage companies, leveraging machine learning models in venture capital is a powerful mechanism to supplement an intuition based industry. The insights from this project would allow for an increased rate of identification of potential unicorn companies that ultimately improve product offerings to consumers. When coupled with proper data and human intuition, machine learning models in venture capital can challenge biases and improve  accuracy in predicting start-up potential. Many firms are already shifting to a data driven approach and have seen successful returns in response. However, the majority of firms utilize these datasets as search engines to locate potential deals leaving a demand for machine learning models that identify key indicators of potential unicorn companies in early stage investments. \n",

    "Given the aforementioned problem and its importance, we set out to tackle the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Can we predict whether a startup suceeds (is acquired) or fails (closes down) based on some characteristics of the startup?\n",
    "* Is k-Nearest Neighbors better than Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees in predicting start up success based on performance accuracy?\n",
    "* Which features most greatly influence the outcome variable? Are there a subset of features that are strongly correlated to the target?\n",
    "* Will feature selection improve overall model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Hypotheses</h4>\n",
    "Null: The success of a startup and its funding features have no relationship (H1,0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative: The success of a startup and its funding features have a relationship (H1,1). \n",

    "As mentioned above, this project aims to predict start up status (closed or acquired). The remaining 29 feature variables are important predictors as they provide additional information on aspects that can play a significant role in a startup's ability to succeed such as funding totals and different funding rounds, market, and state of origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a supervised machine learning problem as we will be developing a predictive model based on both input data (labeled start up feature variables) and output data (start up status). Our project is tackling a classification problem because we are predicting which startups will succeed given a set of labeled feature variables like the amount of funding raised. Our target label, whether the startups succeed or not, is binary and categorical and therefore a classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are planning to try k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVC and Decision Trees. K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm has the underlying assumption that items in close proximity to one another are similar and leverages distance to classify new samples. Linear Support Vector Classification attempts to draw a hyperplane in which the support vector margins are as large as possible. The support vectors are the most useful data points because they are the ones most likely to be incorrectly classified. Decision trees are rule based classifiers that assume that initially, at the root, all the training data is examined. The data is continually split until all data points are isolated to a class.  We are going to try all these because we do not have reason to think that one is better than the other; however, we have chosen to omit the Naive Bayes algorithm because features are not all equally important. \n",
